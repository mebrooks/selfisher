Description: Fit selectivity models in R. The models are fit using maximum
    likelihood estimation via 'TMB' (Template Model Builder). Random effects are
    assumed to be Gaussian on the scale of the linear predictor and are integrated
    out using the Laplace approximation. Gradients are calculated using automatic
    differentiation.
